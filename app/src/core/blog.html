                    <p>No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that's it. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>

                    <p>No! Don't jump! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>

                    <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. It must be wonderful. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</p>
